This project was done during the Fall 2020 semester at IISc.

**Given** raw scalar fields such as velocity components, salinity, etc., the goal of the project was to create visualizations of the eddies present in the Red Sea to obtain insights of the currents.

**Motivation** - The sheer scale of the dataset made it almost impossible to process the data and generate visualizations without crashing our systems using visualization tools like Inviwo. This motivated us to take up the challenging problem of real-time visualization of eddies.

**Achievements** - We were able to achieve real-time visualization (2D and 3D) and analysis of eddies such as position, size, and their evolution with time.

**Drawbacks** - Within eddy information is lost when visualization and analysis is performed by our method.
