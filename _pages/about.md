Hello! I am a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href='https://www.observe.ai/'>Observe.AI</a>, where I am exploring Natural Language Processing.

Previously, I was a Masters Student in the <a href='https://mllab.csa.iisc.ac.in/'>Machine Learning Lab</a> at IISc where I worked at the Intersection of Continuous Optimization and Computer Architecture for Efficient Machine Learning under the guidance of <a href='https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chiru/'>Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharyya</a> and <a href='http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/~govind/'>Prof. Govindarajan Ramaswamy</a>. Particularly, our focus was on pruning Deep Neural Networks. Before that, I obtained a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Ropar.
